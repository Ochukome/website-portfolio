        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Favour Ezet  a creative who’s always been in tech, just from different angles. 

            I started out doing things like content creation, social media strategy, and virtual assistance, but now I’m diving deeper into software development, and loving every second of it.
            
            I currently work as the Social Media Manager at CY Express, where I use strategy and creativity to help brands show up online. I also volunteer with SheCodeAfrica Lagos (which is always so fun!), using my skills to support a community of amazing women in tech.
            
            These roles taught me how powerful tech can be for telling stories, building communities, and solving real problems. Now, I’m learning to build those solutions myself — one line of code at a time. I'm especially drawn to frontend development because I love creating things that are not just functional, but also beautiful and user-friendly.
            
            When I’m not working or learning, I’m probably watching House MD, singing, dancing, or editing something just for the fun of it 
            
            I’m passionate, hardworking, and excited to keep growing in this space. If you love tech, good vibes, or want to collaborate — let’s talk!</p>

            <ul>
    <li>This project was created as part of the <strong>Power Learning Program</strong> and serves as a foundational introduction to Python programming. It features a simple calculator script (`calculator.py`) that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code demonstrates essential programming concepts such as user input handling, control flow (`if/elif/else`), and working with functions. It's a great starting point for anyone beginning their journey into software development with Python.</p>

                    This project is a personal blog website where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on various topics. Built with HTML and CSS, the blog includes a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. It features a clean, minimalist layout with a "Read More" functionality for posts. The project demonstrates my skills in creating user-friendly web pages, working with layout designs, and ensuring that the site is both visually appealing and accessible.
